            Was pretty easy as all of this is a repeat of what we did in lecture. <br> 
            However, I did enjoy it qutie a bit as we get to design our own Page. <br>
            The only trouble I could think of having trouble remembering formatting etc, <br>
            but I just looked back at notes.<br><br>

            What I learned was how to use list more effectively so they don't looks mmess up.<br>
            Most importantly I learn how to use the internet to go the extra step and learned something new.<br>
            I already knew about how to write and paragraph in hmtl and how to put an image up from my ENG 102 class. <br>
            <br>
            The resources i used were the in-class code nodes to help me remember how we do something in class and <br>
            the internet to help me out on generally question or to learn new things. Like center and font size/style, etc.<br>
            The internet I use to explore my curiosity like how do you change font and size in the same line, and going off and a little <br>
            bit of tinkering around I got times new roman in better font!<br> <br>
        </p>

            This Assignment was tougher than the first one but it has helped me better understand how to format using CSS and how Classes <br>
            and IDs work when in the same place. However, the most important skill I learned was how to use the inspect tool to help me debug. <br>
            When I started this assignment I was always getting lost at what class affected what area etc. The inspect tool helped me <br>
            narrow down what I needed to work/debug on. <br> <br>

            I used the inspect tool to help me figure out where I should adjust my padding/margins. Another trouble I had was figuring out how to display inline-block <br>
            and flex and understand what the difference is between them and how they behave. Also using the internet helped me search for Syntax and other little details <br>
            like for box-shadow it helped me understand what each value did which allowed me to create a faint shadow.<br> <br>

            TAs were a big help for me on this assignment as they allowed me to ask questions about why/how things work. They also taught me how to better debug my code and <br>
            key factors on what to search for when debugging.<br>

            My biggest trouble during this assigment was trying to get my filters to work. The trouble I had was how to access the data of each post and comparing it to the selected <br>
            user input. However, after getting some hints from some TAs, I was able to figure a system of how got a filter system working. I did this by creating an array with all the post <br>
            and another array with the curr post. <br> <br>

            What I learn from this assigment is how to debug using the conole.log cmd to see outputs etc. This helps me a lot pin out what was causing trouble and what values weren't correct. <br>
            This help me figure out a bug where my post were being fillter expect for any post I added. One by one I did console.log to figiure out why it wasn't filltering my created post. <br>
            After awhile i figure out that instead of comparing my new post data, it was undfined. Meaning that the new post wasn't getting added into the array. So I only just had to write two lines <br>
            of code to fix it. By making my old selected post update with the new created post included into the array. <br> <br>

            My biggest help for the fillter was the TAs and taking time to debug. For creating a new post, I followed the videos of lecutre that covered the releated topics for it <br>
            Overall this was again a step up from last assigment but I enjoyed learning from it.<br>

        <p class="text-format">
            This was a pretty tough assigment for me as this is my first time doing anything server related, but the lecture videos online helped me a lot in sovling my problems. The trouble I had <br>
            was trying to get my template working, but it kept saying that my template was undfined. Luckly I was able to get it fixed by a TA so the problem wasn't too bad. <br>

            I was able to learn a lot this time around from learning how to make template and how to sort my files to make it easier to work with. Using the interent always helps me wit this assigments. <br>
            Overall a fun assigment that wasn't too bad just needed to work out come bugs along with understanding my tools better and learning how to use them from the TAs. <br>
